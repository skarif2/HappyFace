                           Often front-end development of website is overlooked, out being the part of your project that combines design, back-end development and the layer that y our users interact with, from my experience, it is the ost important to get right.

                           I create responsive wevsites that allow the user to experience your website in the best and most appropriate way suited to the device they are using. By using progressive enhancement, your website is delivered with a responsive layour that can best make use of the space available on the smallest to largest devices. Cross browser compatibility is ensured by using feature detection so older browesers still in use today provide a solid experience, while modern browsers can go the next step and enhace a user's time spent on your site.

                           Writing semantic markup that is documented and wasy to read means it can be maintained and scaled in the future, and allows co-workers to quickly work with it.

                           Rather that create website on a page-by-page basis, I insted consider each element of your screen-based designs as seperate components that can exist elsewere on a website outside of the contest of your design compositions. With these componenets I produce a style guid that acts as a document for a reusable and maintainable code base. All inbolbed in a project can rely on a style guide to understand a project's language and produce a more consistent user experience.

                           I convert designs to high-performance code whilst respecting your designer's compositions. I consider design to be just as important as development and aim to combine both to produce high quality user experience.
